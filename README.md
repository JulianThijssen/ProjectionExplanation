Welcome to the `Projection Explorer` project! This source repository contains the projection explanation plugin built on the [ManiVault](https://github.com/hdps/) system. More about this system can be found at [to be published]().

This plugin contains the source implementation of the paper [Scaling Up the Explanation of Multidimensional Projections](https://diglib.eg.org/bitstream/handle/10.2312/eurova20231098/061-066.pdf). It features:

-   variance attribute-based global explanations as described in the paper [Attribute-based Visual Explanation of Multidimensional Projections](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/attribute-based-visual-explanation-of-multidimensional-projection),
-   a new value-based global explanation showing at a glance which dimensions have unusual values in which parts of the projection,
-   a means of local explanation through lens-based user interaction with the projection,
-   a tool for computing differential local explanations between different areas of the projection,
-   a tool for including or excluding certain dimensions from the explanation in order to dig deeper
